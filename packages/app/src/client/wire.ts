/**
 * Client-side surface bundle — one WebSocket per host.
 *
 * Each host gets its own `surfaceClient` over its own `PartySocket`;
 * the admin surface (host set) gets one more at the reserved sentinel.
 * The cache keeps the PartySocket stable across Solid component
 * remounts so a tab switch doesn't tear down the connection — only the
 * subscriptions inside it.
 *
 * `disposeHostSurface(host)` closes a host's socket when it's removed
 * from the admin collection so the cache doesn't leak.
