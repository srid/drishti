# drishti

**htop for your whole fleet — with nothing installed on the remote.** If you can `ssh` into a host and its Nix daemon trusts you, you can watch its live processes, CPU, memory, and network. drishti ships its own agent *over the SSH connection* on first connect — no package to install, no inbound port to open, no daemon to configure on the far end.

Browser (SolidJS) ↔ local parent server (Bun) ↔ remote agent over `ssh` stdio, on the typed reactive transport [`@kolu/surface`](https://kolu.dev/blog/surface-framework/) (with https://github.com/juspay/kolu/pull/984).

## Demo

▶ **[Watch drishti in action](https://x.com/sridca/status/2060333167463088637)** — a short screencast demoing the multi-host fleet view and live htop drill-down.

## Why drishti

- **Zero install on the remote.** The agent closure is shipped over SSH (`nix copy --derivation` then realise) on first connect and reused after. The remote needs only passwordless `ssh` + a `nix-daemon` that trusts your user — no agent binary to install, no inbound port, no config file to drop.
- **Zero config locally.** No database, no persisted metrics, no setup. History lives in memory for the life of the process. `nix run` and you're watching.
- **One pane, many hosts, mixed arch.** A macOS laptop can drive Linux *and* macOS remotes from a single `nix run` — drishti probes each host's Nix system and ships the matching build.
- **Cross-OS, same numbers.** Linux (`/proc`) and macOS (`sysctl` / `vm_stat` / `netstat`) report the same metrics the same way — memory "used" is cache-aware on both.

## Quick start

```sh
nix run github:srid/drishti                            # localhost (default)
nix run github:srid/drishti -- user@host               # one remote
nix run github:srid/drishti -- localhost a.lan b.lan   # multiple hosts (tabbed UI)
```

Open <http://localhost:7720>. The UI opens on the **fleet** tab — a single overview pane with one live summary card per host (connection state, CPU, memory, load average, uptime, and a 30m CPU/memory history sparkline); click a card (or a host's tab) to drill into that host's full htop. Every view has its own URL, so you can bookmark or share a link straight to a host: selecting a host updates the address to <http://localhost:7720/?host=user@host> (the fleet overview is the bare <http://localhost:7720/>), and opening such a link — or reloading — lands directly on that host.

## Features

- **Live time-series charts** (CPU% / memory%) over a rolling 1m / 5m / 15m / 30m window, switched by a segmented control. The parent server samples every host on each poll tick — whether or not a tab is open — so the chart survives page reloads and tab switches and is already populated the first time you open a host. The **fleet overview** carries the same trend at a glance: each host card shows a compact **30m** CPU/memory sparkline drawn from the same ring (pinned to the widest window, no per-card picker). History is in-memory only; restarting the parent starts fresh.
- **Runtime host management** — the `+ add host` button adds hosts, the `×` on each tab removes one. Added/removed hosts persist to `$XDG_STATE_HOME/drishti/hosts.json` (override with `DRISHTI_HOSTS_FILE`), so `nix run github:srid/drishti` with no args restores the last session.
- **Per-host view memory** — the chart window, process sort column, and process filter stick across reloads via `localStorage`, remembered per host. A **light/dark toggle** (top-right of the tab strip) overrides the OS theme and is remembered globally; until you touch it, the theme follows your system preference.
- **Click a process for details** — selecting a row opens an inline panel above the table with the full (untruncated) command and working directory, exact CPU% and resident memory (plus its share of host RAM), and per-process metadata: parent PID, kernel state, nice value, thread count, and start time. Click the row again, the `✕`, or press `Esc` to close. Thread count and start time are linux-only (darwin's `ps` has no cheap source — they're omitted there, like `cwd`).
- **Idle NICs collapse** behind a `+N idle` toggle by default, so the few interfaces moving traffic aren't buried under the dozens of always-zero virtual ones (utunN, anpiN, …).
- **Strictly read-only** — drishti only ever *observes* a host. The per-host surface exposes no procedures, so there is no way to signal, kill, or otherwise mutate a monitored process through the UI or the wire.
- **Installable PWA** — drishti ships a web app manifest, an emerald aperture icon, and a service worker, so you can install it as a standalone app (desktop, or a phone's home screen) and the shell launches offline. The live process data still needs the connection, of course — the worker only caches the app shell and stays out of the way of the WebSocket transport. Install works out of the box at `http://localhost` (a secure context); reaching the server over a plain-http LAN address falls back to a normal, non-installable web page.

Requirements:

- The remote host must be `ssh`-reachable with **passwordless** auth and a working **`nix-daemon`** that **trusts your user** (`trusted-users` in `nix.conf`) — drishti provisions the agent by shipping its `.drv` to the remote with `nix copy --derivation` and realising it there.
- Localhost works without any remote setup.

Mixed-architecture host sets are supported: the monitor wrapper bakes a `{system → drv}` map for `x86_64-linux`, `aarch64-linux`, and `aarch64-darwin`, and the parent probes each host's nix-system on add (via [`@kolu/surface-nix-host`'s `resolveSystem`](https://github.com/juspay/kolu/pull/1009), which asks the host's own Nix for `builtins.currentSystem`) to pick the matching `.drv`. A macOS user can drive a Linux remote (or both) from one `nix run` invocation.

## Architecture

```
Browser (SolidJS UI, tab strip)
   │  one WebSocket per host  ─────────┐
   ▼                                   ▼
Parent server (Bun, drishti)    Admin surface (host set)
   │  ssh stdio (oRPC) ×N
   ▼
Host 1: drishti-agent     Host 2: drishti-agent     …
   │  /proc on linux; sysctl + vm_stat / netstat / ps on darwin
   ▼
Kernel
```

Host identity lives only at the transport layer: each browser tab opens its own WebSocket to `/rpc/ws?host=<id>`; the parent dispatches to a per-host `RPCHandler` (built once per host from the same surface schema). The per-host `surface` schema (system / processes / cpuCores / networkInterfaces / connection cells) is scalar — no host dimension anywhere in the primitives.

A separate **admin surface** at `/rpc/ws?host=__admin__` exposes the *set* of hosts as a `Collection<string, HostEntry>` plus `addHost` / `removeHost` procedures. The tab strip subscribes to the collection; the `+` / `×` buttons call the procedures.

Per-host primitives:

| Primitive | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Cell** | `system` | Load averages, memory, uptime, OS, hostname. Memory *used* means the same thing on every OS — total minus a cache-aware *available* (reclaimable file cache / inactive / purgeable pages don't count as used): `MemAvailable` from `/proc/meminfo` on linux, derived from `vm_stat` on darwin (since macOS `os.freemem()` counts only truly-free pages and would over-report a healthy Mac at 80-95%). |
| **Collection** | `processes` | Keyed by PID — `{ user, cpuPct, rssBytes, command, cwd, ppid, state, nice, threads, startedAtMs }`. The table shows absolute resident memory (`rssBytes`, auto-scaled to MB/GB); the rest surface in the click-to-open detail panel. Snapshot-then-delta. `cwd` is from `/proc/<pid>/cwd` on linux (empty on darwin / kernel threads / other-user pids). `ppid` / `state` / `nice` come from `/proc/<pid>/stat` on linux and `ps -o ppid=,nice=,state=` on darwin; `threads` and `startedAtMs` are linux-only (`/proc/<pid>/stat` thread count + boot-time-derived start), `null` on darwin (no cheap source). |
| **Stream** | `processesSnapshot` | Bulk-snapshot variant for ~600-PID htop refresh in one frame. |
| **Collection** | `cpuCores` | Per-core CPU usage (`Collection<K,T>` showcase). |
| **Collection** | `networkInterfaces` | Per-NIC network I/O, keyed by interface name — `{ rxBytes, txBytes, rxRate, txRate }` (cumulative bytes since boot + bytes/sec throughput). `/proc/net/dev` on linux, `netstat -ib` on darwin; loopback filtered out. The UI strip collapses idle interfaces (both rates 0) behind a `+N idle` toggle by default, so the few NICs moving traffic aren't buried under the dozens of always-zero virtual ones (utunN, anpiN, …). |

The per-host surface is **read-only** — cells, collections, and streams only, no procedures. The only procedures anywhere live on the separate admin surface below (host-set management), never on a monitored host.

Admin surface primitives:

| Primitive | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Collection** | `hosts` | Configured hosts; key = host string. |
| **Procedure** | `hosts.add` | Spin up a new host session; persists to the hosts file. |
| **Procedure** | `hosts.remove` | Tear down a host session; persists removal. |

## Development

```sh
just dev                          # parent server :7720, host=localhost
just dev user@somehost            # any ssh target with passwordless access
just dev localhost a.lan b.lan    # multiple hosts (per-host arch probe)
just typecheck                    # tsc --noEmit across the workspace
just fmt                          # nixpkgs-fmt everything *.nix
just nix-build                    # build the wrapped monitor binary
just regenerate-bun-nix           # after any bun.lock change
```

`just dev` exports `DRISHTI_AGENT_DRVS_JSON` (the per-system `.drv` map from the flake's `agentDrvsJson` attribute) and boots Bun in watch mode. The parent probes each host's nix-system on add (asking the host's own Nix for `builtins.currentSystem`) and picks the matching `.drv` from the map — so one dev session can mix architectures. The dev server invokes `buildClient()` at startup so a single `bun --watch` covers both server-TS and client-bundle rebuilds. Browser refresh is manual — there's no HMR.

The first connect to a fresh remote ships the agent closure over `ssh` (`nix copy --derivation` then `nix-store --realise`); subsequent connects reuse it. The progress is streamed to the browser via the `connection` cell.

## Deployment (home-manager)

A home-manager module runs the monitor as a systemd user service on Linux and as a launchd LaunchAgent on macOS:

```nix
{
  imports = [ drishti.homeManagerModules.default ];
  services.drishti = {
    enable = true;
    package = drishti.packages.${system}.default;
    port = 7720;                  # default
    hosts = [ "user@host-a" ];    # optional; empty = manage hosts at runtime
  };
}
```

The monitor binds `0.0.0.0` on `port`. `hosts` are passed as positional arguments; leave it empty to let drishti seed from its persisted hosts file (`$XDG_STATE_HOME/drishti/hosts.json`, overridable via `services.drishti.hostsFile`) and manage the set from the admin surface. The packaged wrapper already bakes `DRISHTI_DIST_DIR` / `DRISHTI_AGENT_DRVS_JSON` and puts `openssh` + `nix` on `PATH`, so the service self-contains its runtime needs.

See [`nix/home/example/`](nix/home/example/) for a full configuration — a NixOS VM test exercises the systemd path on Linux, and a standalone home-manager activation build exercises the launchd path on Darwin.

On macOS, the LaunchAgent writes stdout to `~/Library/Logs/drishti.out.log` and stderr to `~/Library/Logs/drishti.err.log`, so crashes and startup failures leave logs alongside other user logs.

### How `@kolu/surface` is wired

`@kolu/surface` and `@kolu/surface-nix-host` aren't on npm. They're vendored from the `juspay/kolu` repo via npins, exposed as Nix-store paths through `nix/overlay.nix`, and hydrated into `node_modules/@kolu/*` by `scripts/hydrate-kolu-packages.sh`. The hydrate script takes `(src, dest)` pairs so adding another `@kolu/*` package is a one-line addition to the overlay + env.

To bump the kolu pin:

```sh
nix shell nixpkgs#npins -c npins update kolu
```

### Why Bun.build, not Vite

The client bundler is a hand-rolled `Bun.build` pipeline (`packages/app/src/server/build.ts`) with a small `solidJsxPlugin` (babel-preset-solid + babel-preset-typescript). Same bundle code path runs in dev (server invokes it at startup) and Nix (build derivation runs it during `buildPhase`). Tailwind v4 compiles via `@tailwindcss/cli` as part of the same pipeline.

### CI

CI runs via [`juspay/justci`](https://github.com/juspay/justci). The canonical pipeline lives in `ci/mod.just`; runners are configured in `~/.config/justci/hosts.json`.

One upstream issue currently shapes how CI runs:

- **crates.io blocks `curl/*` User-Agent.** Every `crate-*.tar.gz` fetched by `bun2nix`'s rust dep tree fails its `pkgs.fetchurl` with HTTP 403. `ci/mod.just`'s `_prefetch-crates` recipe (`scripts/ci-prefetch-crates.sh`) sidesteps this by fetching missing crates with a Mozilla UA and injecting them via `nix-store --add-fixed`. Idempotent and content-addressed, so the workaround disappears the first time upstream fetchurl learns to set a non-curl UA — or once bun2nix's Rust deps fetch from `static.crates.io` directly. Tracking issue: TBD.

AGPL-3.0-or-later (matches upstream `@kolu/surface`).
